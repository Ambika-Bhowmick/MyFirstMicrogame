# MyFirstMicrogame
Project Title: My First Microgame

Description: 
This is a First – Person – Shooter (FPS) that allows the player to have fun by running away from the robots that shoot lasers at the player. It has 8 robots in total, with 2 bosses and 6 smaller robots. There are 7 rooms that contain the robot. In the middle, there are pictures that are for the player to have fun and be motivated to continue with the game. I have a picture of a cat in space, a smiley face, Saturn and an astronaut too! 

Setup Instructions: No setup needed

Reflection: 
I found Unity’s tutorial to be well explained, learning importing assets, moving around in Unity and finding specific things. Also, adding new rooms was easy, I had to drag the items into the area and position them correctly. By putting the rotations, moving and sizing mechanics in a tool bar, it made my life way easier. One thing I found challenging was adding assets outside of the Unity store. My assets weren’t getting on the material properly so when I did it, it would turn out to be pink with no explanation. In the end, I was able to fix it by changing the textures. This was a good introduction project to Unity!
